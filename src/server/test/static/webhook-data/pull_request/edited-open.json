When deployed to App Engine, this file is not needed because it will use Application Default Credentials.\r\n\r\nAdds a new `pre-deploy.js` which:\r\n- Re-compiles the grpc native extension to target the GAE architecture.\r\n- Deletes any unnecessary files from `node_modules` to keep us away from the GAE file limit.",

When deployed to App Engine, this file is not needed because it will use Application Default Credentials.\r\n\r\nThis required adding a step that re-compiles the grpc native extension to target the GAE architecture."
