    "body": "This PR changes how Typescript is built for the client.\r\n\r\nInstead of using just the typescript compiler, this runs the client typescript files through rollup with a typescript plugin to handle transpilation of TS to ES2015.\r\n\r\n- This will build all files in `src/client/`. Rollup is generally designed to have \"entry\" points which we can use in the future if we want, but for now, this seems like most flexible - just build everything as an entry point.\r\n- Also fix the breaking change I made to the dashbaord.",
